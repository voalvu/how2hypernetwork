# how2hypernetwork

Let's create a hypernetwork

1. Find the Train tab.
2. Go to preprocess imgs.
- Set your folder where you collect your "style" or "character" pictures.
- Images need to be processed all into the same size (512x512 by default for SD 1.0 and SD 1.5 checkpoints)
- Output folder just "output" is good, you'll find your fixed resolution imgs here.
- They will be your **dataset**
